## Laravel Microservices Learning Roadmap (Sequential with Dependencies)

---

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Concepts (Must Know Before Coding)

1. Understand Monolith vs Microservices Architecture  
   - When and why to use each  
   - Pros and cons of microservices  

2. Master RESTful API Fundamentals  
   - CRUD operations  
   - Status codes, headers, HTTP methods  

3. Learn Laravel Core Internals  
   - Service container (IoC), service providers  
   - Middleware and dependency injection  

**Why?** This foundation is necessary to understand how Laravel works and how services communicate.

---

### Phase 2: Build a Monolithic Laravel Application

1. Build a sample Laravel monolith project (e.g., an E-commerce site)  
2. Identify clear domain boundaries such as:  
   - Auth  
   - Product  
   - Order  
   - Payment  

**Why?** Helps you understand domain logic and is easier to convert into microservices later.

---

### Phase 3: Refactor Into Independent Microservices

1. Create separate Laravel projects for each domain (e.g., `auth-service`, `product-service`)  
2. Ensure each project has its own:  
   - REST API  
   - Independent database (MySQL or MongoDB)  
3. Implement authentication using Laravel Passport or Sanctum in the `auth-service`  
4. Other services consume this authentication service via token-based APIs  

**Why?** This is the actual breakdown of the monolith into scalable microservices.

---

### Phase 4: Communication Between Services

1. Synchronous communication  
   - Use HTTP REST API calls between services  

2. Asynchronous communication  
   - Use Redis or RabbitMQ queues  
   - Example: when an order is placed, send an event to the payment service  

3. For development, use Laravel's Event & Listener system.  
   For production, consider event buses like RabbitMQ.

**Why?** Enables smooth interaction and decouples your services.

---

### Phase 5: API Gateway

1. Create a central Laravel API Gateway service  
2. It should:  
   - Route requests to the appropriate microservice (`/api/products` → Product Service)  
   - Handle authentication, logging, and rate-limiting  

3. Optionally, use Nginx or Kong as a more advanced gateway  

**Why?** Frontend should communicate with only one endpoint for simplicity and security.

---

### Phase 6: Docker & Deployment

1. Learn Docker and Docker Compose  
2. Create Docker containers for each microservice  
3. Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container setups  
4. Use Nginx/Kong as API Gateway (inside Docker or externally)  
5. Deploy on a cloud platform like AWS, DigitalOcean, or Laravel Forge  

**Why?** Containerization ensures portability, consistency, and easy scaling.

---

### Phase 7: Monitoring & Observability

1. Use Laravel Horizon to monitor queues  
2. Integrate Laravel Telescope for debugging and requests inspection  
3. Use Sentry for centralized error logging  
4. Optionally, add Prometheus + Grafana for custom metrics  

**Why?** Monitoring and observability are crucial in distributed systems.

---

### Phase 8: Scaling & Security

1. Enable horizontal scaling (spin multiple containers of stateless services)  
2. Ensure HTTPS, JWT authentication, and service-level rate-limiting  
3. Manage secrets using environment variables or centralized secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault)  

**Why?** Ensures your application is production-ready, secure, and scalable.

## Sample Laravel Microservices Architecture (Text Format)

```
            [ Frontend Client (React/Vue/Next.js) ]
                          |
                    → [ API Gateway ]
                          |
     ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
     ↓                ↓                ↓
[ Auth Service ]  [ Product Service ]  [ Order Service ] ...
     ↓                ↓                ↓
 [ MySQL DB ]     [ MongoDB ]       [ MySQL DB ]
                          |
              [ Redis / RabbitMQ Queue ]
                          ↓
            [ Notification Service ]
                          ↓
        [ Email / SMS / External APIs ]
```

Each service:
- Has its own Laravel codebase  
- Own database  
- Containerized with Docker  
- Communicates via API or Message Queue  
- Can be scaled and deployed independently
